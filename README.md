# MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for
[MongoDB][1].

Please note that this version of mongo_fdw works with PostgreSQL and EDB
Postgres Advanced Server 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Installation
------------
The MongoDB FDW depends on the official MongoDB C Driver version 0.8 and
includes it as a git submodule. If you are cloning this repository for
the first time, be sure to pass the --recursive option to git clone in
order to initialize the driver submodule to a usable state.

If checked out this project before and for some reason your submodule
is not up-to-date, run git submodule update --init.

When you type `cmake`, the C driver's source code also gets automatically
compiled and linked.

Note: Make sure you have permission to "/usr/local"
(default installation location) folder.

1. To build on POSIX-compliant systems you need to ensure the
   `pg_config` executable is in your path when you run `make`. This
   executable is typically in your PostgreSQL installation's `bin`
   directory. For example:

    ```
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH
    ```

2. Compile the code using make.

    ```
    $ sudo ./autogen.sh --with-master
    $ make USE_PGXS=1
    ```

3.  Finally install the foreign data wrapper.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 install
    ```

4. Running regression test.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    ```
   However, make sure to set the `MONGO_HOST`, `MONGO_PORT`, `MONGO_USER_NAME`,
   and `MONGO_PWD` environment variables correctly. The default settings can be
   found in the `mongodb_init.sh` script.


If you run into any issues, please [let us know][2].

Enhancements
-----------
The following enhancements are added to the latest version of mongo_fdw:

### Write-able FDW
The previous version was only read-only, the latest version provides the
write capability. The user can now issue an insert, update, and delete
statements for the foreign tables using the mongo_fdw.

### Connection Pooling
The latest version comes with a connection pooler that utilizes the
same mango database connection for all the queries in the same session.
The previous version would open a new [MongoDB][1] connection for every
query. This is a performance enhancement.

### JOIN push-down
mongo_fdw now also supports join push-down. The joins between two
foreign tables from the same remote MySQL server are pushed to a remote
server, instead of fetching all the rows for both the tables and
performing a join locally, thereby may enhance the performance. Currently,
joins involving only relational and arithmetic operators in join-clauses
are pushed down to avoid any potential join failure. Also, only the
INNER and LEFT/RIGHT OUTER joins are supported, and not the FULL OUTER,
SEMI, and ANTI join. Moreover, only joins between two tables are pushed
down and not when either inner or outer relation is the join itself.

### New MongoDB C Driver Support
The third enhancement is to add a new [MongoDB][1]' C driver. The
current implementation is based on the legacy driver of MongoDB. But
[MongoDB][1] is provided completely new library for driver called
MongoDB's meta driver. Added support for the same. Now compile time
option is available to use legacy and meta driver.

In order to use MongoDB driver 1.17.0+, take the following steps:

  * clone `libmongoc` version 1.17.0+
    (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver) and follow the install
    directions given there.  `libbson` is now maintained in a subdirectory
    of the `libmongoc`.
    (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/tree/master/src/libbson).
  * ensure pkg-config / pkgconf is installed on your system.
  * run `make -f Makefile.meta && make -f Makefile.meta install`
  * if you get an error when trying to `CREATE EXTENSION mongo_fdw;`,
    then try running `ldconfig`

Compilation script
-----------------
Number of manual steps needs to be performed to compile and install
different type of MongoDB drivers and supported libraries. If you want
to avoid the manual steps, there is a shell script available which will
download and install the appropriate drivers and libraries for you.

Here is how it works:

To install mongo-c and json-c libraries at custom locations, you need to
export environment variables `MONGOC_INSTALL_DIR` and `JSONC_INSTALL_DIR`
respectively. If these variables are not set then these libraries will be
installed in the default location. Please note that you need to have the
required permission to install the directory whether it is custom or default.

The `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable must be set to mongo-c-driver source
directory for successful compilation as shown below,

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$YOUR_MONGO_FDW_SOURCE_DIR/mongo-c-driver/src/libmongoc/src:$YOUR_MONGO_FDW_SOURCE_DIR/mongo-c-driver/src/libbson/src
```

The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable must include the path to the mongo-c
installation directory containing the libmongoc-1.0.so and libbson-1.0.so
files. For example, assuming the installation directory is /home/mongo-c and
the libraries were created under it in lib64 sub-directory, then we can define
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as:

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/mongo-c/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Note: This `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable setting must be in effect
when the `pg_ctl` utility is executed to start or restart PostgreSQL or
EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

Build with [MongoDB][1]'s legacy branch driver
   * autogen.sh --with-legacy

Build [MongoDB][1]'s master branch driver
   * autogen.sh --with-master

The script will do all the necessary steps to build with legacy and
meta driver accordingly.

Usage
-----
The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign server object:

  * `address`: Address or hostname of the MongoDB server. Defaults to
    `127.0.0.1`
  * `port`: Port number of the MongoDB server. Defaults to `27017`.

The following options are only supported with meta driver:

  * `authentication_database`: Database against which user will be
    authenticated against. Only valid with password based authentication.
  * `replica_set`: Replica set the server is member of. If set,
    driver will auto-connect to correct primary in the replica set when
    writing.
  * `read_preference`: primary [default], secondary, primaryPreferred,
    secondaryPreferred, or nearest.
  * `ssl`: false [default], true to enable ssl. See
    http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/mongoc_ssl_opt_t.html to
    understand the options.
  * `pem_file`: SSL option.
  * `pem_pwd`: SSL option.
  * `ca_file`: SSL option.
  * `ca_dir`: SSL option.
  * `crl_file`: SSL option.
  * `weak_cert_validation`: SSL option, false [default].
  * `enable_join_pushdown`: If `true`, pushes the join between two foreign
	tables from the same foreign server, instead of fetching all the rows
	for both the tables and performing a join locally. This option can also
	be set for an individual table, and if any of the tables involved in the
	join has set it to false then the join will not be pushed down. The
	table-level value of the option takes precedence over the server-level
	option value. Default is `true`.

The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign table object:

  * `database`: Name of the MongoDB database to query. Defaults to
    `test`.
  * `collection`: Name of the MongoDB collection to query. Defaults to
    the foreign table name used in the relevant `CREATE` command.
  * `enable_join_pushdown`: Similar to the server-level option, but can be
    configured at table level as well. Default is `true`.

The following parameters can be supplied while creating user mapping:

  * `username`: Username to use when connecting to MongoDB.
  * `password`: Password to authenticate to the MongoDB server.

As an example, the following commands demonstrate loading the
`mongo_fdw` wrapper, creating a server, and then creating a foreign
table associated with a MongoDB collection. The commands also show
specifying option values in the `OPTIONS` clause. If an option value
isn't provided, the wrapper uses the default value mentioned above.

`mongo_fdw` can collect data distribution statistics will incorporate
them when estimating costs for the query execution plan. To see selected
execution plans for a query, just run `EXPLAIN`.

		"warehouse_id" : NumberInt(2),
		"warehouse_name" : "Laptop",
		"warehouse_created" : ISODate("2015-11-11T08:13:10Z")
	}
)

-- delete row from table
DELETE FROM warehouse WHERE warehouse_id = 2;

db.warehouse.remove

	{
		"warehouse_id" : 2
	}
)

-- update a row of table

db.warehouse.update
(
	{
		"warehouse_id" : 1
	},
	{
		"warehouse_id" : 1,
		"warehouse_name" : "UPS_NEW",
		"warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z")
	}
)

-- explain a table
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM warehouse WHERE warehouse_id = 1;
                           QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Foreign Scan on warehouse  (cost=0.00..0.00 rows=1000 width=84)
   Filter: (warehouse_id = 1)
   Foreign Namespace: db.warehouse
(3 rows)

-- collect data distribution statistics
ANALYZE warehouse;

```

Limitations
-----------

  * If the BSON document key contains uppercase letters or occurs within
    a nested document, `mongo_fdw` requires the corresponding column names
    to be declared in double quotes.

  * Note that PostgreSQL limits column names to 63 characters by
    default. If you need column names that are longer, you can increase the
    `NAMEDATALEN` constant in `src/include/pg_config_manual.h`, compile,
    and re-install.
